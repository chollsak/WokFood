          "FoodDescription": "The dish is most popular on Cook Island (a territory of New Zealand). This is something like ceviche, but with a tropical spin. The tuna's high protein and rich coconut milk will nourish you while you work (or play).\nWhile I've used tuna here, you can also use grouper or snapper. You can easily make 75 small appetizers on crostini or serve 6 people a good, lunch-sized portion."

          "FoodDescription": "These strips of twisted puff pastry will challenge your adulthood in less than 20 minutes in the oven - hardly enough time to make a realistic plan of resistance. They're crispy, buttery, and cheesy - but they wouldn't be from down under if they didn't have signature Aussie flair - a generous smear of Vegemite. The black, yeasty spread adds malty, salty smack as well as deep umami to the outside.\nI added a bit of chopped rosemary to green up the flavor, but thyme would do nicely as well."

If you can make your way to a large Asian market, you’ll probably be able to find some perfectly pre-shredded for you. While there, grab a bag of frozen grated coconut. Moist and naturally sweet, it tastes completely different from the dry papery shreds we find in the baking aisle."

Also, keep in mind that the cassava needs to have the tough, woody stems removed before grating. I tried spinach and chard in place of the island cabbage and found the chard to be slightly easier to deal with."

As my mom likes to say “Waste not, want not.” In the Solomon Islands, when Papaya trees hang heavy with more fruit than locals know what to do with, they don’t let it rot and fall to the ground. They don’t let the monsoons sweep the fruit away, either. Oh, no. Instead, they make use of the papaya at every stage of growth… ripe or unripe… which is how PawPaw Curry makes its way onto the dinner table. While the sweet flesh of ripe papaya is grand (perhaps baked with sweet coconut cream?), pawpaw curry is made with the mild, firm flesh of an unripe papaya. Serve with rice."

          "FoodDescription": "When Samoans want to bite into the holidays, their kitchens fill with the warm scent of cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg. If you try to peer under the lid to see what’s cookin’, you’ll more than likely get a full steam facial, so watch out. Within that foggy cloud of vapors, you’ll find cocoa brown puligi, a steamed bundt cake made dark with the unusual addition of “burnt” sugar. The cake is traditionally steamed in an underground oven known as an imu, although many now steam it on the stovetop, or as I have done in the oven."

For me, I feel the best substitute is bits of real dark chocolate although cocoa powder is a possibility, too. Keep in mind, depending what you use, you’ll have to play around with the quantities."

The dish is traditionally made with young taro leaves and coconut cream wrapped in older taro leaves (the end result looking like a little pouch), which is then baked in an underground oven called an imu, but Samoans who have immigrated to the USA have assured me that spinach makes a fine substitute and a casserole is great if you can’t get the right leaves. As for the coconut cream, you can make this by shaving coconut flesh to produce the thick mixture, if you have time on your hands otherwise canned coconut milk (full fat please) tastes great."

In fact shrimp would be the dainty option; often they'll use humongous prawns and serve spicy chili sauce on the side for dipping.\nTo give the shrimp authentic spice without sauce I added a sprinkle of brilliant cayenne... a spice the color of a Papua New Guinean sunset and a fishermen's dream."

I’m happy to say that I’d eat Pavlova any which way – even if it was invented on the moon.\nSince we’re making Pavlova in honor of our New Zealander Global Table, we’ll be adding slices of fresh kiwifruit (be careful not to call it kiwi, as that is the state bird as well as a nickname for local New Zealanders). Kiwifruit is a major export of the island nation."

I also removed the milk/vinegar combo in favor of more coconut milk, as (I’m told) milk products are not very common on the islands."

It’s all I know…)\nI had my reservations about consuming raw fish in landlocked Tulsa, Oklahoma – but, after taking a big sniff, the fishmonger assured me the mahi-mahi was fresh. What a flavor sensation it is – mild fish swimming in a blast of tart lime juice and cloaked in creamy coconut milk. I added a bit of hot pepper to give even more dimension, but you can use regular green peppers if you’d prefer.\nTIP: Ask your fishmonger to skin the fish and remove its bloodline.\nTIP 2: If you have leftover coconut milk from a can, use it to make some Grilled Corn with Coconut Milk."

Their special twist is a hearty helping of curry powder. If you’d like to make it even more Fijian, try swapping the potatoes with taro root and/or chunks of yucca. Also, Fijians would typically make this dish with canned corned beef – but I wanted to go the extra mile for Saint Patrick’s Day! Thanks Fiji."

The result? An all-purpose curry that will taste great on almost anything.\nThis version ended up quite a bit different than Bittman’s, most notably because of a little extra cardamom and a bit less fennel seed. I’m just not that into fennel. If you’d like more heat, try mixing in extra cayenne until you get a blend you like.\nIf you want bonus points, toast and grind each spice individually – you’ll be able to toast the spices more evenly and you’ll also have better control of the grind. You know… unless you have a little Miss Ava to keep up with."

          "FoodDescription": "The act of “saucing” food in Singapore is not as simple as I expected it to be. From what I can tell, there’s two schools of thought on the matter.\nFirst: the ‘dip & dunk’ variety, a.k.a. those who keep a bowl of incendiary hot sauce next to their plates for regular food baths.\nSecond: the ‘drizzle & bedazzle’ variety, a.k.a. those who let the sauce rain down over their food, free-form.\nWhile I wouldn’t normally expect this to be a big deal, the foodies of Singapore are so impassioned that they are more than happy to come up to you and show you their preferred method… especially if you look even the littlest bit unsure (this happened to Bourdain countless times on his No Reservations trips there).\nAt her most basic, locals blend together a happy assortment of red chillies (preferably something like a red fresno) amped up with the crazy heat of a couple of Thai bird chilies (pictured above). The beauty comes from the dance of flavors – puckering lime juice, biting garlic, invigorating ginger, and a bit of sugar and salt to balance it all out. Surprisingly to me, some hot chicken broth seems to be standard. The benefit of using hot broth is that the heat makes quick work of melding the pungent ingredients.\nWhile traditional methods chop the chillies and grind them in mortars and pestles, I made quick work of the recipe with a blender. I prefer this because then the garlic and ginger is smoothly and evenly distributed. For a little texture, you could slice up the Thai bird chilies and float them in the sauce."

While the tropical spread would be incredible between cake layers, the most traditional use in Singapore is on toast for breakfast or teatime."

The rice is a bit bolder, smacking of sauteed shallot, garlic, and ginger… and is plumped up with the very broth created by poaching the chicken. Some of the broth even gets used to make the chili sauce.\nNothing good wasted."

          "FoodDescription": "I’m here to warn you that kimchi is one of those dishes – a Mount Everest for some culinary Adventurers and a potential moon landing for our beloved but stubbornly picky eaters. Here’s why: Kimchi is fermented, pickled, fishy, spicy, and totally funky. It can take months and months to make, fermented in large vats with such delicacies as raw oysters or fish chunks. Astonishingly, the end result shouldn’t be overly fishy but mildly sweet and sometimes spicy, although there’s a little residual zing from the fermenting.\nLest you run away in fear, let me assure you – two entire countries – North and South Korea – eat kimchi with giddy enthusiasm some people reserve for birthday cake… so I say go for it. Expand your mind. Buckle up. Enjoy the ride. This Kimchi recipe is quick and simple. It’ll get your feet wet in the world of fermented cabbage. The entire process takes no more than 3 days (and 98% of it you don’t have to do anything).\nYou just might come out on the other side with a new favorite dish."

The result? An all-purpose curry that will taste great on almost anything.\nThis version ended up quite a bit different than Bittman’s, most notably because of a little extra cardamom and a bit less fennel seed. I’m just not that into fennel. If you’d like more heat, try mixing in extra cayenne until you get a blend you like.\nIf you want bonus points, toast and grind each spice individually – you’ll be able to toast the spices more evenly and you’ll also have better control of the grind. You know… unless you have a little Miss Ava to keep up with."

Our corn on the cob is a little simpler – basted straight up with plain coconut milk. The creamy coconut milk gives corn a mild tropical flavor – perfect for a summertime barbecue. Serve with extra coconut milk on the side, for those who like to slather on extra coconut goodness."

The insides break down as they set in the salted water, so the texture becomes rather mushy. Use a sharp knife when slicing to preserve the beautiful lime shape.\nCambodian pickled limes are easy to make but take a little time – you’ll probably need start two weeks ahead. Hot and sunny temperatures are necessary to dry out the limes quickly. When we made them, temperatures were floating around 104 (with a heat index of 111F). I may have set a world record for time to dry out six limes. Two days!\nNOTE: You could also use small key limes for this recipe."

They also add hot green chili peppers for kick. Anything from an anaheim to a jalepeno would work well for this recipe. I’m a half hot pepper kind of gal. Keith’s more of a whole hot pepper. If you’re a no pepper person, that works too – though a touch of heat does add a layer of authenticity to the dish. But the biggest difference of all with Yemeni shakshouka is that, in Yemen, the eggs are scrambled, not poached. The result is sunshine yellow, highly spiced, and a great conversation piece for brunch (or even an easy dinner). Serve it with flatbread, like naan or pita."

Then he shrugged in the direction of the peanuts, almonds, and pistachios, indicating that I could decorate the cake with any sort of nut I desired. His speech quickened as he rattled off a list of possibilities : rose water or orange blossom water; folding in coconut or even just sprinkling it on top; that I might consider adding yogurt; and, when it comes to leavening, that yeast or baking powder are both acceptable."

You can make it as spicy as you’d like with red pepper flakes (or go wild with cayenne, if you must).\nP.S.

The highest quality flows creamy white and is called luban, meaning “milk,” although the color can vary from soft yellow, to rich amber or even luminous green. It just depends on the season. While you can find ice cream with sprinkles of frankincense resin on it all over Oman, the creamy ice cream as I’ve made today seems to have been popularized by a woman named Trygve Harris. Her creamy scoops draw Omanis and foreigners alike.\nWhile you can get lost in wisps of Frankincense Ice Cream any time of year, I’d highly recommend serving generous bowls during the winter, when the crunch of snow and pine surround you and your heart is filled with the holiday spirit. Frankincense Ice Cream would also be a grand addition to a Halloween party. After all, the mysterious scent of Frankincense transforms even the humblest room into a fortune teller’s parlor… equal parts creepy and mysterious. Finally, any ice cream – even Frankincense – is great right now, in the glint and glimmer of summer. Just don’t drop your cone."

The main difference between this and ordinary corn bread is that it doesn’t rely on cornmeal, but actual corn to flavor the bread. Mealie Bread is a treat you will find throughout southern Africa. In olden days, it was steamed over a campfire, with little more than ground corn, wrapped up in husks. They used white corn, not sweet, yellow corn. The end result was more of a wet corn pudding.\nToday’s southern Africans, however, love mealie bread with more of a bread consistency, so they include flour. The jury is out, however, on whether or not the corn kernels should be pulverized smooth, or left with a few larger bits, as I have done. Personally, I love how the occasional burst of whole kernels reveals that fresh corn went into this recipe."

My adaptation relies on the wisdom within The Africa Cookbook by Jessica B Harris (an amazing panorama of African cooking which makes a great addition to any kitchen bookshelf).\nMost pure, traditional renditions of Yassa provide only a bit of habenero and slippery peanut oil for dimension along with the bright onion and lemon marinade, but modern Senegal has also stirred mustard, olives, and carrots into the pot, perhaps in a nod to the influence of old Portuguese settlements. The occasional pop of a briny olive adds add richness and a simple sort of excitement to this one pot dish.\nThe meal is best served with rice, perhaps a few slivers of tomato,and will gladly suffer some candlelight if a campfire is out of reach in the hustle and bustle of things."

          "FoodDescription": "This filling, yet healthy Portuguese stew made it’s way to the islands of São Tomé and Príncipe during colonization. Things have evolved quite a bit since then. While most Feijoada’s involve black beans (even as far away as the one we made for Brazil), the islanders favor this white bean version and make it with readily available fish (and sometimes pork).\nThe entire principal is a slow-cooked, tender meal full of flavor from raw beans. In the old country, a variety of herbs and spices might be added, but things are simplified on the islands. Some recipes don’t even include the carrots as I have (and they might as often be substituted with cabbage). The really distinct part of São Tomé and Príncipe’s recipe is the red palm oil – a signature ingredient in West African cooking. I found mine at Whole Foods, but you can get it a lot cheaper at local African markets (such as Ebute Tropical Market in Tulsa).\nSince the fish cooks so quickly, I opted for a weeknight friendly Feijoada… something that can be thrown together in 30-45 minutes (almost that entire time is hands off). If you’d like to go the mellow, slow-cooked route, use soaked dried beans and fresh tomatoes. Be sure to cook the beans until tender before adding the fish."

This is a Nigerian drink made for parties – supposedly invented by a Nigerian bartender named Chapman and, although I wasn’t able to find any solid facts on the history, I like the idea that there is a real live person behind the drink.\nThere are as many variations as there are bubbles in Chapman. The general idea is to mix orange soda (traditional would be fanta) with a lemon/lime soda (like sprite). I went with natural izze sodas and later made a version with san pelligrino. Both tasted bright and zesty.\nPerhaps the most fun part of the drink is its rosy color, which can be added with either black current syrup or non-alcoholic grenadine. Grenadine will make the drink bright pink, while cassis will color the Chapman dusty rose. For a bit of beauty and juicy flavor – add a handful of sliced fruit – I used sweet orange and lime moons, although I’ve seen versions with banana slices, cucumber, or even pineapple pieces.\nThe finishing touch is a splash of angostura bitters, which lends a nice woodsy flavor. From what I’ve read, while the soda flavors can change up a bit (all orange or all lime, for example), a Chapman is not a Chapman without the bitters."

Since it’s leavened with baking powder, there’s no long rise time – just pop in the oven (or over a campfire) and chow down. No muss, no fuss.\nSpices like ginger, cinnamon and cloves give this rugged, dense “wheaty” bread a lovely lift. Much like Irish soda bread, Veldt bread tastes best when steaming hot, slathered with butter. So go ahead, set up camp by a Namibian sunset and enjoy a slice."

Traditional recipes include so much oil that a red ring forms around the base of the beans. I’ve been fairly modest with my addition for health reasons and because I find the flavor of red palm oil quite strong. Play around with it – start with 1/8 cup, and add more at the end of cooking until you like the taste."

As far as who had more fun with this – me, Mr. Picky, or Miss Ava – it might have been me. I spent most of the time squealing while I waited for the first few to explode… I mean… pop."

The heat comes from berberé, the regional spice blend that should be added with a heavy hand.\nEdited to add: One of our readers posted a great tip in the comments section of our Ethiopian menu which also applies to Eritrean cooking: \"When I watch Ethiopian cooks in Ethiopia they chop up red onion very tiny (I use a food processor and stop short of pulverizing as it helps it cook down faster) and then dry cook it in the pan — no oil. They dry cook it stirring constantly until it turns almost into a paste — imagine the consistency of a good roux. It takes a lot of onion to get the right amount of this paste. Then add the oil/lentils, sauce stuff, etc. The onion paste is actually the thickener for the wat — if you don’t do this step properly then the wat ends up too soupy/watery or you end up having to put in too much other thickeners.\" -Sandra\nWhile our version is nice and dry (and tastes lovely as is), you might be interested in playing with this technique sometime."

There’s a simplicity to the recipe that means a batch can be made as easily at midnight as in the afternoon. Which means you can stovetop travel to the beaches of Venezuela any time you like.\nWhile you can make cachapas with fresh corn in the fall, you can also use frozen corn any time of year. Corn gives the cachapas sweet overtones. Masa harina – a flour made from hominy, the big-kerneled cousin to corn – binds the mixture together so the corncake holds its shape (all the better for topping with ooey gooey cheese!).\nSpeaking of cheese, the key to the cachapas is to sprinkle them with a shredded soft cheese, fold in half, and eat while steaming hot. You can use queso mano, a soft mild cheese favored by Venezuelans, though shredded mozarella is a fine (and delicious) substitute. Some Venezuelans pass on the cheese, preferring to butter the cachapas."

This may sound counter intuitive in a sweet drink, but the touch of salt really is lovely, traditional, and nearly undetectable."

This mild caramelized milk spread is the perfect complement to the whisper of lemon inside the cookie.While we’ve made homemade dulce de leche several times for this blog, I took a shortcut and purchased La Lechera Dulce de Leche (I found it at the local supermarket next to the condensed milk).

It’s not a straight up copycat operation, however – they add plenty of unique touches, to make Chow Mein their own. For example, although they prepare it with soy sauce, they call the soy sauce “Chinese Cassareep” – a nod to the locally prepared cassava based juice that they douse on almost everything. Also, they slather it with a scorching hot sauce made from habeneros. One popular brand is called Matouks.\nWhen it comes it ingredients, they often add green beans (or long beans), peas and other simple vegetables. Bok Choi is a big hit as well. The noodles can be round or flat, although round is more common (except in homes where the wrong package of noodles is purchased. Yes, I did that). In all seriousness, as long as you make this dish with egg noodles, you are good to go. Just be sure to top with some firey hot sauce. Caribbean-style.\nOptional? Serve it with Curried Chicken Kabobs [recipe]."

Today, this hearty dish is typically made with dried beef (carne seca) and pork meats – usually sausages, like paio, and ribs. According to my Brazilian classmate from high school, “cow tongue is also super popular (and yummy).” Like chili in the USA or Beef Bourguignon in France, there are as many recipes as there are mammas (and papas) cooking.\nServe Feijoada with farofa (manioc flour pan-toasted in butter), sweet orange slices, and white rice. Sauteed kale is a popular side dish too. Although this green is bitter, you’ll be glad you made it because feijoada sends diners begging for veggies to balance out the beans and meat."

I even saw one Swedish video which used prepacked cake, already sliced in thirds."

She’s an entire meal, surrounded by tender lettuce, hard-boiled eggs, cucumbers, tomatoes, more gherkins, and whatever else you’d like to nibble on.\nRadishes? Sure. More apple slices? Absolutely. Steamed asparagus? That’s totally Dutch. Swap the ham for beef? Yes, yes.\nWant to eat your potato salad in a lettuce wrap? Do it with a smile!"

The quickest way there is with hagelslag, or a “hailstorm” of sprinkles, on buttered bread (no need to toast it). While it sounds incredibly unhealthy, dutch sprinkles are high quality treats and there’s even guidelines for what can be called hagelslag. Most are at least 35% cocoa with 100% cocoa butter (this means there are no weird fillers, like vegetable oil, as you’ll find in cheap sprinkles)."

There are all sorts of shades of gray (that’s where the beauty is – somewhere in the muddled middle).\nSo, in the spirit of variety, we’re adding a few shades of gray to our pasta. We’ve got black pepper, white feta, and charcoal grey buckwheat noodles with a bit of sparkle from pools of golden olive oil.\nThis is simple as can be and a fantastic chilled pasta salad for a hot summer’s day. And did I mention? It’s also gluten-free.\nYou can buy buckwheat noodles (a.k.a. soba noodles) or make them yourself for a fun afternoon project. I tried this both ways and, while I loved the satisfaction of making the noodles myself, I also loved the easy, breezy simplicity of popping open a package of pre-made buckwheat noodles and having dinner on the table less than ten minutes later."

This is big food.\nThis is the original “super-size.” Not only are the patties large enough to cover a small plate, they contain as many as 6 cuts of meat from three different animals. Everyone has their variation and you’ll typically find beef, lamb, and pork (for non-Muslims) in every bite. The entire animal is fair game.\nYou can’t help but smile as your mouth stretches open with every bite.\nWhile each region (country, town, family, person!) has their own variation, most chow down on pljeskavica with a knife and fork. More recently, tucking the patty inside lepina, or thick pita bread with onion and tomato, is gaining popularity. Either way, don’t forget to slather each bite with roasted ajvar spread!"

And be sure to raise a glass to Provence and even sunny Monaco."

The long cooking time gets the jerk seasoning extremely caramelized.\nNow, for those of you who want to go all out, you can easily get your meat much darker than mine (and spicier), by basting the chicken with extra jerk seasoning as it cooks. I had a toddler to feed, so I kept it a little lighter."

Instead she was told to sit quietly and watch. She remembers how, as Assunta rolled the dough thinner and thinner, it gradually swallowed up the table and heavy oil cloth covering. Eventually, all you could see was the giant sheet of dough – thin enough for spaghetti, linguine, tortellini or – as was typically the case – ravioli.\nI’ll tell you right now… The secret is in the slap. By occasionally slapping the dough down onto the table, the gluten relaxes, making it easier to roll out without springing back. That and generously dusting the dough as you go."

I, too, was dark green by the time we stopped for lunch at a quaint restaurant nestled under a cliff. Unfortunately – or fortunately – Greek food awaited. There was no time to be sick.\nWhile I have no memory of the main course, I do remember the dessert – yogurt with a dollop of golden honey. I’ve thought of it often since then, much like an elderly woman dreams of young love. Of course, at the time, I was nowhere as poetic. In fact, I met the dessert with an ugly face. A yuck face. I almost pushed it away, but – on a whim – decided to give it a chance.\nThank goodness for small miracles."

Feeling creative? Shape it into men, women and children. Feeling pregnant? Just make little buns, baby!\nThere’s also plenty of choice in regard to flavorings. Pulla always tastes of glorious cardamom. After that? You can leave it plain or fill it. Sweeten life up with a bit of brown sugar, butter, and spices (that’s what we opted for in this recipe), or get things movin’ with some prune filling. You can even fill it after baking with a bit of jam and whipped cream. Usually this is assembled “hamburger style” with a bun sliced in half and whipped cream gilding the outer edges of a jam-burger.\nWhat to expect: No matter how you handle it, pulla should not be anywhere as sweet as a cinnamon roll. The soft, rich dough is quite a bit more subtle than that. The dominant flavor will be cardamom, with a background zing of cinnamon and the barest drop of ground cloves. Sugar remains a delicate background flavor.\nNote: For a slightly lighter (but less rich) dough, try replacing 1/4 cup of the milk with water."

Let rise and bake.\n2. Cut a rectangle; spread with filling, then roll up like a cinnamon roll. Cut log into discs. Take discs and pinch the two sides to hide the filling. Bake.\n3. Make small balls with dough. Let rise, then press the center down with thumb or fingers until it looks a bit like a doughnut. Fill indentation with filling, let rise again, and bake.\n4. Cut a rectangle – spread with meat filling. Roll up and pinch ends. Let rise, then bake."

Finally, cheese is sprinkled on top, as is your choice of meat (beef, pork, or browned chorizo) and a garden’s-worth of toppings (think avocado, tomato, cheese, cilantro, lettuce, and jalepenos).

When I saw the rum, brown sugar, butter, and coconut,… oh man, I knew I wouldn’t quit until this treat was in my tummy. It whips together in just a few minutes (Bonus party talk? All the ingredients can be waiting in your pantry for those friends that just “pop over” during the holidays). While traditional recipes use white bread, I found whole wheat gave the bread pudding a little oomph in the face of the mad, wonderful richness."

I used that $20 pan I got at the Indian market back when I first began our Global Table Adventure."

Traditional dumplings just bob and float. Spinners and Sinkers are also incredibly easy to make – an ideal activity for children – and, in my opinion, quicker to throw together than a traditional dumpling.
